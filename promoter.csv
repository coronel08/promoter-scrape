Fremont Abbey Arts Center Edit, Booker Link: https://www.fremontabbey.org/booking/, Booker Email: abbeybooking@gmail.com Booker Link: https://www.fremontabbey.org/booking/ Booking Tips: Be sure to put "Booking"  act name  and desired date(s) in the subject of your email and desired date(s)  Seattle show history  social media links  line up ideas  and a link to your music in the body of your email. "We are generally not able to keep up with email inquiries regarding booking with the same rapidity that other for-profit venues might be able to afford (we do try to read all emails though). If you are an established act and can help put together a strong lineup (100+ people with $7-10 ticket on Tuesday or Thursday usually)  feel free to present your ideas! Bands share in the promotions  too  so be prepared to work hard. To book a weekend here  it would likely have to be off-peak season (Jan-March/July) or an established lineup with a proven draw of 150+ people with an $8-15 unless we have a night still open within 2 months. Keep in mind that we’re not a loud rock venue and the 10pm Noise Ordinance (and our room acoustics) restricts full bands from playing loud drums/guitar/bass/etc. Generally speaking  acoustic or mellow-ish bands fit well here at the Abbey anyway due to the live acoustics of each room. We do seek out many developing artists to perform with established bands at The Round and other concerts and events that we curate and produce. If you’d like to be on the support list please indicate that in your subject line with “SUPPORTBAND” all one word. Most Abbey shows under 70 presale (1 day before) will be downstairs in the Gallery space  larger shows in the Great Hall upstairs at the Abbey staff discretion. Other venues vary."
